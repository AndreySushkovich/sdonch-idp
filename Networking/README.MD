### HTTP: Stateful or stateless?
Please demonstrate the answer to this question by making the necessary changes to the web module.

### Persisting state on client side
Implement simple shopping cart.

The application will consist of 2 screens: "Products" (simple table with product names and "Buy" links, "Check out" submit button) and "Order Confirmation" (appears after user has pressed "Check out" button on the previous screen; displays contents of the shopping cart).

State is to be persisted on the client side. jQuery is prohibited (pure JavaScript without any frameworks).

##### Questions
1. How would you send the information about selected products to server?
